**I like building machines and have spent most of my career developing technologies for scientific instrumentation and performing new kinds of measurements on condensed matter systems.**  I have investigated topological phases, exotic magnets, and superconductors, and I enjoy thinking about ways in which interaction-driven electronic phases can be used to support new technologies.  I am currently working with transition metal dichalcogenides in Professors Jie Shan and Kin Fai Mak's laboratory at Cornell University, supported by a Kavli Institute at Cornell postdoctoral fellowship.
